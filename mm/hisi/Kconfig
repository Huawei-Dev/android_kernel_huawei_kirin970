menuconfig HISI_MM
	bool "Hisilicon MM support"
	---help---
	  This option add some hisilicon mm codes, needed by following modules.

if HISI_MM

config HISI_SLOW_PATH_COUNT
	bool "page alloc enter slow path count"
	default n
	help
	  Say 'Y' here is you want to count page alloc slow path.

endif

config HISI_PAGE_TRACE
	bool "HISI page trace"
	---help---
	  This option enables hisi page trace, needed by memleak check modules.

config HISI_MEM_OFFLINE
	bool "Dynamic Memory Region Offline driver"
	depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	help
	  Add support for DDR Self-Refresh power management through the dynamic
	  memory offline framework. This driver interfaces between the memory
	  hotplug subsystem and AOP which hot adds or removes memory blocks and
	  controls the start/stop of self-refresh of these DDR regions. This
	  helps reduce power consumption during idle mode of the system.
	  If unsure, say N

config REFAULT_IO_VMSCAN
	bool "Refault io vmscan"
	default n
	---help---
	  This is a new vmscan algorithm to balance anon and file lru reclaim ratio by
	  detect file and anon refault cost. This can more effectivity reclaim memory and
	  decrease totoal refault count and maybe decrease system cost.
